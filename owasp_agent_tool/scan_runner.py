"""Runs a scan in a background thread so the API can return immediately
and the UI can poll for status, instead of the browser request hanging
for however long the ZAP active scan takes.

This never touches the Anthropic API - it only calls Orchestrator.scan(),
so no API key is required to use it. Findings land in the pending queue,
not the triaged findings table, until someone approves AI review.
